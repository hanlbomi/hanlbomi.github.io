                    <p>
                    In data science, datasets often contain both numerical and textual data, requiring analysis to extract insights. By combining text data analysis with numerical techniques, we can reveal important patterns and trends that deepen our understanding of complex phenomena. This integrated approach empowers decision-makers with a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
                    <br><br>
                    Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a vital role in managing textual data in data science, which frequently includes non-numerical formats. Utilizing NLP methods like sentiment analysis and topic modeling, we extract valuable insights from both textual and numerical data. This holistic approach not only identifies patterns but also enriches decision-making by providing a complete perspective, bridging the gap between quantitative metrics and qualitative textual nuances.

                    The Mental Health Corpus<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> is a collection of texts from people facing mental health issues like anxiety and depression. It contains messages labeled to indicate whether they suggest <strong>mental health struggles (1) or not (0</strong>). Researchers and mental health professionals can utilize this data to explore language patterns related to mental health. It assists in tasks such as understanding sentiment, spotting harmful language, and analyzing mental health discussions. By examining these patterns, we can develop systems to detect early signs of mental distress and offer effective support.

                    The dataset contains 27,977 text messages. It's worth noting that the data is evenly split (i.e., balenced), with 14,139 instances indicating health struggles (50.5%) and 13,838 instances not indicating them (49.5%).

                    <br>
                    Text preprocessing is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves cleaning and preparing textual data for further analysis. Below, we outline a step-by-step analysis using the initial text message:<br>
                    <strong>"dear american teens question dutch person heard guys get way easier things learn age us sooooo thth graders like right guys learn math".</strong>
                    <br>
                    In the forthcoming analysis, we employed the Python module "nltk," widely recognized as a prominent tool in the realm of NLP (<span style="color:blue;">import nltk</span>).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    
                    <span style="font-size: 1.0em; font-weight: bold;">1) Tokenization </span>
                    <br>
                    This is the process of splitting a text into smaller units, such as words, phrases, or characters, known as tokens.
                    After tokenizing the initial text message (<span style="color:blue;">tokens = word_tokenize(text)</span>), it can be represented as follows:<br>
                    <strong>['dear', 'american', 'teens', 'question', 'dutch', 'person', 'heard', 'guys', 'get', 'way', 'easier', 'things', 'learn', 'age', 'us', 'sooooo', 'thth', 'graders', 'like', 'right', 'guys', 'learn', 'math']</strong>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-size: 1.0em; font-weight: bold;">2) Stemming </span>
                    <br>
                    Words exhibit various forms and tenses. For instance, the verb "go" may appear as "go", "goes" "went", "gone", and 'going' in texts.
                    It's essential to map them to their base or root form by removing suffixes (<span style="color:blue;">stemmed_token = stemmer.stem(tokens)</span>).
                    <br>
                    <strong>['dear', 'american', 'teen', 'question', 'dutch', 'person', 'heard', 'guy', 'get', 'way', 'easier', 'thing', 'learn', 'age', 'us', 'sooooo', 'thth', 'grader', 'like', 'right', 'guy', 'learn', 'math']</strong>
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-size: 1.0em; font-weight: bold;">3) Filtering </span>
                    <br>
                    Filtering out tokens with a length less than 3 is a common preprocessing step in NLP. This helps reduce noise in the data by removing tokens with minimal semantic meaning, such as single characters or very short words (e.g., "a" and "us"). Additionally, it improves efficiency by reducing vocabulary size and subsequent processing time. Moreover, removing short tokens can enhance model performance by mitigating overfitting and focusing on more meaningful features.
                    <br>
                    <strong>['dear', 'american', 'teen', 'question', 'dutch', 'person', 'heard', 'guy', 'get', 'way', 'easier', 'thing', 'learn', 'age', 'sooooo', 'thth', 'grader', 'like', 'right', 'guy', 'learn', 'math']</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    We applied these three steps to all 27,977 text messages. For a cursory examination, we segregated the text messages into two groups based on the label (1 = health struggles and 0 = normal) and generated word clouds
                    (<span style="color:blue;">wordcloud = WordCloud.generate(text)</span>)
                    
. Notably, the text messages associated with mental health struggles (<strong>left</strong>) exhibit more occurrences of words like "feel," "like," and "know," whereas the other group (<strong>right</strong>) features more occurrences of words like "film" and "one."

                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Vectorization is essential in NLP to convert textual data into numerical format, enabling machine learning algorithms to process them effectively. By transforming words or phrases into numerical vectors, vectorization facilitates tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and language modeling.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In NLP, there are various methods to turn words into numerical forms, like Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Word2Vec. Each has its pros and cons, particularly in how much information they convey and how efficiently they manage memory. Ideally, testing all these methods would help find the best one for our model, but that would be time-consuming. Therefore, for this project, we opted for TF-IDF, a popular choice in NLP.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Implementing TF-IDF is straightforward in Python:<br><br>
                    <span style="color:blue;">from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer</span><br>
                    <span style="color:blue;">tf=TfidfVectorizer()</span><br>
                    <span style="color:blue;">data_vec=tf.fit_transform(text)</span>
                    <br><br>
                    This command yields a large sparse matrix, representing the vectorized form of the texts.  <br><br>
                    (0, 29298)    0.21987335376865433 <br>

                      <br>
                      The size of the matrix is 27977 rows by 54449 columns, where each row corresponds to a text message, and each column represents a vectorized word. The sparse format is employed to conserve memory.<br>
                      (Use this to covert to a normal dense array: <span style="color:blue;">dense_array = data_vec.toarray()</span>)

                    <br>
                    Once the text data has been vectorized, the next step is to construct a predictive model. Since we have labeled data indicating the true values, we opt for supervised learning. The dataset is divided into two subsets: the training set and the test set, accomplished using the train_test_split function from the sklearn package.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span style="color:blue;">from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split</span>
                    <br>
                    <span style="color:blue;">x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(data_vec,y,test_size=0.3,random_state=1)</span>
                    <br>

                    In this instance, a test size of 0.3 was chosen to allocate 30% of the data to the test set, leaving the remaining 70% for training.

                    For modeling, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is employed. SVMs are known for their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and binary classification tasks. <br>
                    <br>
                    <span style="color:blue;">from sklearn.svm import SVC</span><br>
                    <span style="color:blue;">svm = SVC()</span><br>
                        <span style="color:blue;">svm.fit(x_train,y_train)</span><br>
                            <span style="color:blue;">y_pred=svm.predict(x_test)</span><br>
                            <br>
                            The model is trained on the training set (x_train and y_train), leveraging the SVM algorithm to learn patterns from the vectorized text data. Subsequently, predictions are generated for the test set (x_test).

                            Upon evaluation, the model achieves an overall accuracy of 92%. Furthermore, when examining the performance across different labels, it is observed that the accuracy for label 0 data is 92%, while for label 1 data, it is slightly lower at 91%.
